## [2026-07-10] validation | Harden validator numeric and URL type checks
- Checked current time at 2026-07-10 00:42 KST; no freeze guard was run per current project policy.
- Hardened `scripts/validate_weekly_news.py` so boolean ranks/scores are rejected and non-string `source_url` values report validation errors without crashing duplicate-URL checks.
- Verified the malformed-fixture path, weekly data validation, JS syntax, Python bytecode compile, and local browser smoke checks.
